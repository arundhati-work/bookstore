# Bookstore

**Problem Statement**   
Create a simple bookstore application where the owner can create and edit books. Each book must have the following properties:  
1. ID  
2. Name  
3. Author  
4. Quantity

The customer need to be authenticated with email and password. They can then add books to cart and buy them. The customer can have access to view books in the store and add them to cart.
Once the 'buy' button has been clicked, show a success message and flush cart.
Create a simple UI and two user groups: owner and customer.
